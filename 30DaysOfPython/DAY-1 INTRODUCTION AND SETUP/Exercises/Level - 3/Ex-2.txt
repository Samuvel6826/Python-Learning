✅ Problem

Find the Euclidean distance between two points:
P₁ = (2, 3), \quad P₂ = (10, 8)

⸻

📌 Step 1 – Formula

The Euclidean distance between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) is:

d = \sqrt{(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²}

This comes from the Pythagoras theorem: distance is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle formed by horizontal and vertical differences.

⸻

📌 Step 2 – Apply values

d = \sqrt{(10 - 2)² + (8 - 3)²}

d = \sqrt{8² + 5²}

⸻

📌 Step 3 – Square each difference

d = \sqrt{64 + 25}

⸻

📌 Step 4 – Add

d = \sqrt{89}

⸻

📌 Step 5 – Square root

d ≈ 9.433981132

🐍 Python Solution

import math

# Points
x1, y1 = 2, 3
x2, y2 = 10, 8

# Euclidean distance formula
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

print("Euclidean Distance:", distance)

Output:

Euclidean Distance: 9.433981132056603

📊 Why 2 squares and 1 square root?
	•	We square each difference:
	•	(x₂ - x₁)² = 8² = 64
	•	(y₂ - y₁)² = 5² = 25
	•	Then we add them: 64 + 25 = 89
	•	Finally, one square root gives the actual distance: \sqrt{89}.

👉 This matches the Pythagoras theorem:
c² = a² + b² \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = \sqrt{a² + b²}
where a = 8, b = 5, and c = 9.43.

⸻

✅ So the Euclidean distance between (2,3) and (10,8) is √89 ≈ 9.43.
